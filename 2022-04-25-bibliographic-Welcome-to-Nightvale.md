## Welcome to Nightvale
The readings this week really focused on the experience and the hidden workings of the digital format in a way that I found to be fairly interesting. The content of the readings was extremely interesting and some that I have encountered before such as AI Dungeon because I’m a big nerd. I think the use of bots to create stories, or mimic speeches is something that makes me laugh, seeing what they understand to be human actions. The Football reading somewhat reminded me of a popular podcast and web series Welcome to Nightvale or at least it did to me. I actually favorited it because I thought it would be interesting to visit again in the future.

The weeks readings spoke to me about how we can and might be experiencing literature or “books” in the future as it shows that in some ways having good design can make up for the lack of margins or the lack of total direction. Which I think speaks to what kind of genre are popular with millennials as something like “What Football Will Look Like in the Future” or Welcome to Nightvale can be very popular without total cohesion. It also just reminded me about there are some services that like send you a “case file” or something with clues and puzzles that you solve to understand the narrative and that could also be lumped into this conversation about interface and experience.
