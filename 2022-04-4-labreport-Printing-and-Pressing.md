## Printing and Pressing
As a historian who writes about crime and violence in a period long before print culture, I use the words of “greater” men to describe a world unknown to use and use evidence to piece together the pains and stresses of a people I can never know. Something that literary scholars seem to miss is the humanity of the humanities, seeming to focus on the form and the function of a piece as well as the cultural significance rather than the lived lives of those who participated in that piece. I felt that this was shown very well in the “Farewell etaoin shrdlu” piece. After working with the printing press and feeling the weight and doing some of the manual labor, you gain an appreciation for what people must have been feeling and how much their labor must have been to produce hundreds of sheets to form the books that scholars poor over for literary analysis.

If I were to describe the culture around print, I would focus on the information given to the everyman. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was common for the man who could read in a tavern or a pub to read the newspaper to those who could not, this disseminated information similarly to previous periods, but in an even wider and “impartial” means as it is not town criers or government officials spreading news to those who heard it. This gave power to the people in the governance of their own knowledge and information as they had a printing, and it could sway them and those around them. Even to those who could not read there would be elaborate woodcuts, some of the most famous such as the woodcut of the Boston Massacre creating huge upheavals and desire for action; even when the even itself was certainly overblown by the print media of the colonial era. A major cost of such a print culture, as seen in the English Civil War is that there is so much information being disseminated amongst the population that it is hard to accurately parse through it all, similarly to today. Each faction and different religious sects had their own pamphletry that they would spread across the whole of England and would cause major misconceptions regarding certain groups, such as the Adamites that would walk through the streets naked and perhaps never were in England at all (Learner Heresy of the Free Spirit 1972). This can cause distrust in print and the rise of “fake news” and “echo-chambers” of information shared only amongst a group. Additionally, a possible cost or affordance of such a society would be labor required from such a wide printing culture.

The reason that labor could be a cost or an affordance would due to how that labor is sourced and how it is maintained. Since printing is, as demonstrated by our own printing experience, a labor intensive and skilled job, it would require workers who could learn that trade and also should be able to read. Similarly to the rise of the industrialist factories it could cause a spike in literacy rates, but also at the cost of lowering the value of printing labor by creating a large, mostly poor working class who would do the labor for you. It could be an affordance if that society was able to create a union or guild system that would protect the workers against those that might seek to exploit their labor and efforts for financial gains. But, I believe that if people are given a challenge of how to make the most money, they tend to rise to that challenge.
