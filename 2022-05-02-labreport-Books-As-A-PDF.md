### The Book as a PDF
___
Since the beginning of this class, we have asked the question “what is a book?” and as typical academics and students of higher education; we made the answer far more complicated than it necessarily needs to be. I still believe that the exercise was valuable as it allowed us to really get into better understanding of the book as an object, but also as an intellectual idea. We spent months reading Borsuk’s The Book and we questioned how it is that we interacted with or intelligently parsed books and conveyers of knowledge. I think back to “The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species” by Ken Liu and it reminds me about how we can understand books as not only a physical object or as a conveyer of knowledge but also as a cultural artifact that has its own understanding and significance. It is something that we touched on briefly as we talked about how the book is understood and how that understanding changes based on societal norms and how the form of the book is somewhat part and parcel with out belief of what a book is.

I, personally, still believe that it is the cultural attribution of a book that makes something a book; but I also feel that the medium in which that book takes is less important that some have made it out to be. I do not see a meaningful difference between a PDF and a physical object except in so much of how I interact with that object. It may color the way that we read an article or a book, but it can actually enhance our ability to understand and interact with that article or book. Highlighting and text to speech are two that come to mind immediately when I think of advantages of a PDF. As long as the PDF is well made you can highlight sections where I am loathe to do so, I do not want to ruin my books by putting loads of highlighter on it, just not the type of person that I am. So, when I think about the datafication of the book, I believe that it does not fundamentally alter the form in which the book is but allows for greater access and comprehension of the book as a form and medium. As someone who does listen to books and who has siblings that tend to use the text to speech function on PDFs and online textbooks, I think that it allows people to engage with the material in a way that gives them the best avenue for successful understanding.

I think that while the datafication of books could alter the book further in the future, that I do not believe that we are abandoning it entirely and I think that we live a time of shift and change, the question just remains on what we plan on keeping and what we plan on leaving for the future.
