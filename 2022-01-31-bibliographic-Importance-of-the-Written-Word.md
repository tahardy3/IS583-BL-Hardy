# The importance of the written word

When thinking about this topic and reading the required readings for this week I feel that the authors were touching on, but somewhat skirting around the idea of the empowerment created through the rise of printing and the printed word. Especially in Northern Europe there is an explosion in the proliference of non-conformity that is demonstated through printing. It really isn't touched on in the readings besides slightly in Borsuk, also Kesler as mentioned later, when talking about the booming population and the need of literacy. There is demonstrated statistical evidence in the explosion of small print media during the period of 1450 to 1550/1600 that shows not only an understanding of the use of media and campaigning that is quite unique as well as a need to let others know about individuals opinions. Lots of pamphlets were printed during this period that showed off the vast range of political, religious, and cultural ideas of this period and it shows how important the printed word was to the "little people".

Suffice it to say that the majority of the articles and chapters talked about the importance of books and how to understand the nature of books from the early modern period and where and how we got these books, but they don't really delve into the world of the "unwashed masses" as Alpert-Abrams focuses on the church. The only one that gets close is Kesler who focuses on the Indigenous and their relationship to the book and media  but it's really more of an anthropological study on how they transmit and understood tradition and cultural information without the use of written language for the most part.
