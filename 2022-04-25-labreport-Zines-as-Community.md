## Zines as Community
I think that it is important to understand the world in which Zines and other analog materials are used for the purpose of solidarity and collective ownership. I think that we all agree that zines have been a mode of expression for those without voice since their inception, especially in for women, queer, and people of color. It does not take very long to understand why such a medium was necessary for the production of printed works for these individuals; especially in times prior to the Civil Rights Act. Today, zines still hold their place in society due to the fact that even with laws and modernization, we really have not changed and desperately cling to the white patriarchy as a society due to how our system is run. Even looking at something such as the “Cultural History of the Punch Card” I thought it was obvious how it was a way of marking and tracking people though the use of a physical object, and in some ways Zines did the same thing in a voluntary way.

What we had talked about in class about Zines showed that the culture of Zines was sometimes a community tight nit even across the country due to some adding their physical address or phone numbers on the product and allowing it to dispense. This “voluntary” tracking was a way for those who felt oppressed by the system and who may not have known anyone else who was queer in their community to not feel so alone and vulnerable. In a pseudo-similar fashion, Gary Gygax of Dungeons and Dragons fame, had his phone number listed and would answer calls by the community and those able to get a call to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; allowing the community to actually interact with a creator before a time of Twitter, where people may not have known other D&D players, or just wanted to talk about the game.

The zine community is all about resisting the mainstream and keeping their community strong through interaction and freedom of choice. I think that this is something that needs to be understood and reciprocated by scholars and library professionals that want to work with these zines and maintain them. If available, working with those that actually produced the objects or, if not, working with the community in which it was produced in order to have an open dialog about these objects. Sometimes people do not want their work to persist after them, or have them preserved and we need to honor that as a commitment to our communities. I think that access, rights, and freedoms are something that need to be openly discussed and should be front and center, zines were meant to be shared and shared alike with a honest community, and that tradition should follow, even in a “special collection” space, such as with the Queer Zine Archive, where it is open and curated by the community, not by prescriptive metadata made by cis-gendered straight white men as is the case in many archive institutions.
