## Books and Paper
When reading the article discussing the Newspaper Navigator it made me think about how my fellows in the history program, especially those focusing on the 18th and 19th centuries have a much larger breadth of information and sources to work off of then myself, focusing on the ancient world. When you have only a dozen or so sources that everyone uses, translates, and discusses back and forth you get a much deeper insight but you lose out on the uniqueness of each source, you aren’t able to find an article in one local newspaper that shows how the people of a region thought about the event you are writing about. It just shows how much can be done just through looking at something as simple as a newspaper to grant you insight into the zeitgeist of a generation. The article also speaks to the microfilming process and how it alters the process and might make machine learning more tedious as it could connect two images due to physical defects rather than for content. But this forces me to ask the question. Would you have rathered anything else? Libraries and Archives were and are bursting at the seams with newsprint paper and all of it acidic, all of it brittle, all of it disintegrating and taking up so much space that no one wanted to deal with it or could. I think that microfilming was the best solution at the time and certainly saved a lot of newsprint for the use of machine learning, without them being microfilmed it is possible they would have been handled to death and we’d have no copy of it left.

I never imaged to see “razzle-dazzle” in a published article before, but it made me at least take not of the History of Books article as I thought it was something worth commenting on. I think it’s noticeable that the author seems to subscribe to a very specific notion of what a book is and so is very selective about what the history of books and the large industrial complex around books grows. I think it was interesting to see it from their perspective, especially as they try to bring the book history community back to a larger discourse.
