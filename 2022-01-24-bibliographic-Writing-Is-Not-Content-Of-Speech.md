## McLuhan's Claims and Other Observations
When reading through McLuhan, as we talked about in class, that there was a lot of definitive claims and "truths" that McLuhan makes that just are not accurate in regard to how technology affects and changes the world around us as well as our perception of the world as it is. I just felt that he made too many claims that were made to be final. Especially with how much discussion we got out of that article alone in our class.

This is doubly true when we look at how the other authors have been able to refute or struggle with how McLuhan defined words their uses. This was expressly true in Le Guin and Liu who had their own definitions and presented a technology and media as complicated introductions that cause change over time, rather than the teleological approach that McLuhan presented.
