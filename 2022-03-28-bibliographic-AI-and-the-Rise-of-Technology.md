## AI and the Rise of Technology
I noticed that for this week only one of the readings actually had a PDF and so that made the readings for me, actually take a lot longer as I work less well with straight text on a page. I won’t say that the Anatomy of an AI system didn’t make my eyes cross whilst reading, it is just at the point where I feel that it is beyond my understanding to actually try to think about what processes and when looking on the map; but, I did find the rest of the article to be very interesting as it points out the many literary and cultural effects and influences on the Amazon Echo. I also found it interesting, as I often have expressed, how it regards the costs of manufacturing as stated, “Large-scale AI systems consume enormous amounts of energy. Yet the material details of those costs remain vague in the social imagination.” I think my main question is what the clean and messy data would mean for long term preservation, if messy data actually had a negative impact on the preservation quality of the document then there might be more understanding on my part of the debate, but at this point I wasn’t totally sure what the point was.
