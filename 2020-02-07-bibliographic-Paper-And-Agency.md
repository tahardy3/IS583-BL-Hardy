# Paper and Agency
When reading the articles for this week, sans Gitelman since I could not find a copy of her article anywhere, I found sense that paper, and the printing industry was not simply just the production of books and pamphlets for the general consumption, it also granted agency in a way that was unexplored previously. With the advent of printing and the rise in the printed word as mentioned in Borsuk's chapter, we see a greater legal agency as individuals may petition the Crown for the right of their intellectual property. 

Intellectual property right and copyright is a morass that continually obscures and causes frustration amongst those attempting to learn it and the may ways around said laws; but, it is a fundamental right of a creator to own and hold onto the works that they produce and therefore seeing them in a time where the legal affordances under the British Common Law and other law codes are less defined, it makes an interesting dichotomy of rights and privilages. This intellectual freedom and agency is also seen in Senchyne's introduction and conclusion when they speak to the power of paper and printing in Early America, especially as that agency and intimacy was being peeled away by the rise of industry in our fledgling nation.
