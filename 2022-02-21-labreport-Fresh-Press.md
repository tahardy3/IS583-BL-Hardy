# Fresh Press Lab Report
Going into Fresh Press was interesting to me as I have family that are really into living as environmentally friendly as possible with the removal of meat and animal-based products as well as trying to keep local and forageable plants in their diets. This is something that I believe has become increasingly popular with our Millennial generation as we see the warning signs of irreconcilable disaster ahead of us and are trying our part to change our future. So, I thought that the idea of a carbon neutral, or even carbon negative, paper making process was something that could be very interesting, and I was hoping to see more of the logistical feasibility of this process. After listening at Fresh Press and doing some of my own research I found that it is technically a feasible endeavor however with the cost of replacing machinery and changing production it may be difficult to pursue.  My main takeaway was about the stability and resistance of the paper to change over time and from what I heard at Fresh Press it would be quite similar to pre-industrial papers but would certainly require more processing in order to produce as smooth a result. The character of the products at Fresh Press were great and I think that, especially for the artist realm, it will be very popular; but, it may not attract major publishers or manufacturers as it is not as clean and smooth as they might like it to be. 

What this experience made me think of was how this contrasted with handmade rag paper that I had purchased from Twinrocker in Indiana last semester. It had similar characteristics, especially in grain formation and general feel, but Twinrocker was made on a much larger scale being 18 by 24 inches and using those for bookmaking as I have experienced. Main contrast was in process and in color as Twinrocker paper is mostly cotton papers and is done with more machinery than seen at Fresh Press. But both make me think of the old vat men and apprentices in early modern Europe and how much work they had to do in a single day. The University of Iowa really put it in perspective with how much work they had to do to meet the quota of an “average” paper maker of 1000-2000 sheets in a day. That kind of labor is insane and early makes me connect with the paper we had looked at in the RBML.

This all contrasts with the rise of digital products as we talked about in discussion a few weeks ago and the rise of e-readers and non-paper products. As someone who uses both paper and electronic products I find that my attention is maintained through the physical medium at a might higher level than with electronic product. That’s why I believe that the idea of a “paper-less” paper product could prove to be really interesting and a bridge for those who haven’t made a full transition to digital or can provide that tactile feeling and “normalcy” that some people crave. But, of course, that is not without its issues as I would be wanting to know about the security and privacy risks of these devices as well as the resources that went into the actual creation of these products. As I had mentioned in class, we rarely think about how our phone is made and how it is almost exclusive sourced through “sweat-shop” labor and penny-on-the-dollar labor. All of this has to be taken into account, not only the environmental affect of the creation of billions of mechanical devices, but also the human affect of this crushing labor the most in-need of our global community.
