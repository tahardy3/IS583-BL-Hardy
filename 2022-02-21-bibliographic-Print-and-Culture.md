# Printing and culture
When reading the works for this week, it felt less coherent than in other weeks as there was such a breadth of material, and all were so different that it caused a lot of confusion for me as I was trying to make a coherent through line besides just printing culture. However, in my struggle of finding congruency, I did find some questions or comments that I thought would be worth thinking about. My first main question is Elyse Graham talks about the “information revolution” and its usefulness as a term and metric, how else might you determine the intersection of technology and ideas and how change occurs over time without such terms? As a historian I find that while labels can be misnomers, they also can narrow your scope and allow one to focus on specifics rather than speaking about the whole of period history. 

Another question or idea is about how even into the mid-20th century we still were using the handset typeface for printing at the industrial level, and it wasn’t until the dot-matrix and even digital printing of the later half of the century that we saw change, just imagine the amount of labor and man-hours required to print then versus now even as those books printed 50 years ago degrade and disappear due to brittleness or use.

I think finally, my that Shareen, Ozment, and Levy’s article downplays some of the wider global phenomenon that women printers had been and were becoming as there are prominent printers in Italy during the Early Modern period that were renowned for their work, commissioned even by the Pope and they were women. I just thought it was interesting. Overall, I thought their work was fantastic and would like to see more work done in this field, which is why I thought it was somewhat sad that they hadn’t taken it to a more global scale.

On a personal note, I really loved the two mid-century vocational films they were great and I always love that war period film as it was so technical while being somewhat digestible. One of my favorite examples is the how a car axel works and films like that from the car industry, it’s honestly amazing.
