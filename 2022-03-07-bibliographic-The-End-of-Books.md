## The End of Books

I really thought it was interesting to read the End of Books this week as it made me think about how we as humanity have changed so little in the grand scheme of things; in our wariness of the new, the way we communicate, and how we insult each other. It made me think about the Pompeii graffiti that says things such as “Antiochus hung out here with his girlfriend Cithera” and “Secundus likes to screw boys.” Like these quotes, the End of Books really highlights how we are continuously wary of the new thing and like to say that it is the end of our ways of doing, even if that just is not true. We could say that the typewriter was cold and mechanical, but handwriting didn’t die. The internet makes our lives easier and allows us to connect the world over, but that didn’t kill camping, road trips, or just walking through the park. We are so worried about what has changed that we don’t see what is the exact same. Also, I thought it was funny the comment about “modern art”, sounds exactly like older family members talking about Banksy.

Additionally, I was thinking about the future of printing as is covered in the other readings, thinking about how technology might change and what we might be able to have in the future; but, I also remember the early 2000’s where we believed we’d have flying cars or subsurface highways. The commentary about “binding” in the Many Books of the Future was an interesting topic that I think we started to hit on a few weeks ago with the structure of PDFs and the comfort of having margins.
