# composition lab report
In the fifth lab, we worked on the composition of a piece of literature that meant something to us and arranged it upon the block to print with it in the coming week. In our composition, we were able to examine and experience the physical elements and trails that came with composition and one of the roles that one may work in a commercial printer of the early modern and modern period. What came most evident to me is that even with just setting type, there was a fair amount of physicality that was required from compositors, lifting the fonts, setting the type, and being able to have the dexterity to maintain and hold together that block of text with simple pressure and friction. I was glad to be standing rather than stooping or leaning over the tables as some of the other students were. This gave me something of an advantage as I was not in as much pain. I have a long-standing knee injury that would make the leaning and stooping portion difficult, and as we had discussed in class, it was more traditional to do composition standing. I also believe that using the composition desk helped me because the angle kept the letters in place when I was searching for letters. Should I do it again, I may want to use larger lettering; however, the 14 point font certainly caused challenges with figuring out what letter is what, but the notches aided with it once you got a feel for it.

During this week, we talked about the culture of printing and the world that movable type and other printing methods operated within that focused more on a level that was more focused on the technology and the movement of material culture rather than the people that were performing these jobs. I think that it was enlightening to take time to compose only a short number of lines and how long it took us to do it. Of course, as mentioned in class, we were novice at best and so did not benefit from the years of experience that an actual printer was bound to have; however, it does make me appreciate how much effort and craftsmanship went into the printing that so many people take for granted today.

Reading what Benjamin Franklin wrote and thinking about the labor and production of written materials throughout the period made me appreciate the ease of typing on this computer. I was thinking specifically about how we still used this type of moveable type well into the mid-20th century, as demonstrated in the vocational films for this week and how Benjamin Franklin described it. The labor and skill of this profession would change how I would teach a class on the topic of printing. I believe that with this knowledge, I would want to, if able, have a demonstration of the skill or have a discussion about the labor and the costs of the printing industry. I would want my students to know and feel the gravity of the pages they are reading in the Rare Book Room, about the amount of time and people it took to produce that document. My brother does not beat me as his apprentice, and I had not done skilled labor as a young boy. I just work myself to death in grad school.
