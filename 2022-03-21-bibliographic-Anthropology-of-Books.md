# Anthropology of Books
This weeks readings I actually struggled quite a bit with, but I think it is because I am quite sick throughout this weekend and it has affected me in more ways than just physical. I found that the Wigginton article was actually one of the more interesting to me because of my background in History and Anthropology. I found compelling argument in their article about the importance of illustrations and “books within books” as a way of finding meaning and expression from a marginalized community. As someone from New England I found it interesting that the Wampum belt was mentioned only in passing as well as other forms from other parts of the Americas. I just found it to be somewhat odd since it presents a wide array of cultural forms of passing information that is not seen in the Euro-centric view of “books”.  I also found the Book Faces article to be extremely interesting and actually sent it to my sister at The Ohio State University with her Ph.D that specialized in African-American Art History and Education. We talked back and forth about the importance and power of the author portraits. I think that it really shows the deep biases that are implicit in out society or explicit and how even now the book faces are not the same as they were when originally published, I think it speaks volumes that even as we try to claim progress or change, we are still very much the same but with a new coat of paint.
