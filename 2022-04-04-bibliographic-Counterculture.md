## Counterculture
Zines, as part of their very definition and even in the code of ethics, are defined by being counter-cultural, challenging the power and influence of the printing and publishing community by creating something that is entirely unique or entirely their own. It allows those who are not “traditional” writers, authors, artists, or communities to get their vision and their narrative printed and disseminated to an audience that appreciates the wide array of colors in the spectrum. I think that it’s interesting that in the Zine Librarian and Archivist code of ethics that they very directly point out that the library community is often one that supports and reads zines, but are not neutral and need to remain accountable to the community. I know that before getting into the Library and Archives community that I had never heard of a Zine and I had to ask the question in one of my first classes at UIUC, what was a zine. I think that it shows how to some people, especially to those with traditional privilege that zines do not really penetrate those audiences as much. 

I did question why lumping Zines with Scrapbooks, but I think that I understand the kind of self-publishing and the choice of representing yourself and the situations around you is similar in some respects. It just feels odd to me as I wouldn’t necessarily have equated them together, but I felt that the idea of fanfiction being closer in scope. One question I was thinking of when reading the article regarding fanfiction was “how do you represent the wide array of influence in fanfiction?” My thought being that there is quite a bit of overlap and creative borrowing between authors and even collaborations or spin-offs of fanfictions that could create a very gnarled web if done poorly.
