### Introduction

___

  

In the last week of this course we talked about memory and it caused us to really dive into the realities of archival preservation and also the ways that we choose actively or passively to preserve things for the future. Not every family tradition is or has to be maintained for posterity and some are held with such reverence that we choose to exclude those elements of that tradition that may be unsightly and this is also true in the academic sphere. Therefore I decided to take a critical look at the preservation decisions of academia through the lens of a personal repository, understanding the ways that we use our memory and exclude those that might be less than desirable. Putting this more plainly for those who are not as versed in academic archival theory, I used theory and practice I have learned and applied these theories to my personal things and wanted to know how or why the decisions are made or how those decisions would change the way historians and other academics interact with my records.

  

As a caveat, I understand that this is not strictly a “by the books” experiment, but I wanted to make it not only interesting for me and perhaps to my instructor as something he has not interacted with or thought about before; I wanted it to be practically helpful to me by using and combining my theory from the iSchool, History Departments, and from this class into something that would actually tell me something that I wanted to know. I plan on using many of the weeks in this class, such as the Barnard, Megan and Gabriela Redwine piece from 2016, and my other classes as reference for this experiment and I hope that through this thought experiment and application, you’ll be able to see my vision as it plays out.

  

### Experiment

___

  

Starting off with my experiment, I decided that I wanted to understand what types of files I had, the information of these documents if any, and most importantly the format of those files. To connect this experiment as closely as possible to this course, I decided to focus on digital files and formats rather than physical, understanding how the arrangement of metadata and digital space changes our interaction with these formats. In addition, I wanted to touch on obsolescence and how it plays a role in how “memory” functions in a society relying more and more on digital formats. To do this, I used a combination of format identifiers and then data miners similar in function to that shown in the week 12 discussion if I am not mistaken. Using these I was able to find out more or less, what intellectual groupings might be present in my files and that I have far more graphic materials than I have textual ones, almost 6 times the amount, mostly creative works of art and reference materials.

  

Once the format and more or less grouping might be, I decided that I had to choose the importance of these documents and present them in a logical way so that, if necessary, I could give this scale to an untrained professional and they would understand it. I scaled low to high value (content) and low to high fragility (format). Value was defined by the Society of American Archivists as “the ongoing usefulness or significance of records, based on the administrative, legal, fiscal, evidential, or historical information they contain, justifying their continued preservation” (SAA 2022) and of course this is broad and perhaps in need of narrowing for my purpose. This is part of the issue of “memory”, things are decided to have “value” based on their content and usefulness to either a populace or to commercial enterprise which can totally eliminate swathes of material and ideas from seeing fruition. Many things of “traditional knowledge” that remain from the 19th century are due to anthropologists racist ideas and believing that the march of progress would kill or assimilate all native culture and so they should save it to show off; but despite this, much of this knowledge might be lost otherwise. In an article by JSTOR Daily they explain that this knowledge has become a node of contention and that, “It’s easy to misinterpret the metaphorical language of an indigenous culture as though it was a literal belief,” (Luu 2019). It is our job, our obligation to understand and see value even beyond that which we can imagine and that is the crux of preservation.

  

Finally, after making all of my documentation, I created a retention schedule and criteria for deaccessioning that would be of use for those coming after. All of these files are written in either markdown or in plain .txt files for digital archives convenience as they are both lightweight and are relatively stable in the grand scheme of file types. Specifically I made a note to keep an eye on the formats for Adobe products and Google formats such as .gdocs as they are proprietary and therefore their archival stability is reduced when compared to a .txt or .md file that do not require a specific software in order to be used. For when items are in separate locations, such as on Google Drive, Github, or another online platform, I also made backup copies of these objects so that should servers crash or be taken down, they would be maintained. Writing appraisal criteria and retention periods for my own digital repository was quite difficult and I had to research different types of archival schedules in order to see how other repositories appraise and cull files from their institution. However, I found that archival decisions are always exclusionary at some capacity and therefore objects of lower value at the moment are often disregarded as unimportant and while even I was looking at my own works, I could not be immune to the effect of thinking files and works were “trash”. Thus concluded my experiment as I had gone through the procedures of creating my own digital repository and outlined the rules of their use for future generations, regardless of what might be left on the cutting room floor.

  

### Analysis and Reflection

___

  

I think first and foremost I thought about how these objects might actually be used and how the arrangement, description, and the selection of these objects were made for the benefit of the repository and for the user. A fine line must be ridden in order to provide the best access and best practice for our users and I think that is at the core of modern archival theory, being able to understand that we might make mistakes and that while we cannot save it all, we must make the best decision we can for the future. I believe that is partially what Young, Peterschmidt, and Frazier are getting at in their “File Not Found Series” that obsolescence is ever moving and that we cannot save many of these technologies from degradation and failure (2017). However, I think part of the beauty of collections and modern scholarship is that we recognize that things continue to degrade, but we accept this as fact and use it to emphasize engagement and being able to read between the lines.

  

It is in the vein of this philosophy that Nowviskie writes about speculative collections and histories about those not represented by the records; these people were not preserved by those in their time but what does their absence tell us and how do the records that we do have explain their lives (2019). This experiment allowed me to experience what it was like to make such decisions about things that I personally made or produced and not in a vacuum of separation. I think it was sobering to understand that I was not able to keep all my photos, drawings, writings, or other files, but made me resolved to choose those that I felt represented that which I thought might appeal to an audience like me; historians, scholars of the past that want to know how the other half lived.

  

Finally, I thought about how this makes me understand the exchange of ideas and how transitions to digital formats have changed the way that we interact with documents and repositories. For perhaps the first time in history we have documents in repositories that are not “dead” as they remain constantly in flux due to the nature of digital formats. In archival theory this is seen as a three-dimensional model of archives where the object is simultaneously different things and serving different functions without sacrificing any of them. This idea is so novel it can be difficult to wrap your brain around but simply put, you can have documents safely stored in an institutional repository, but also still having it be used for its original use, or being held by third parties and each of these functions are unique and non-conflicting. It is an interesting first step into the world of digital archives and the very unique challenges that face a traditionally analog profession in a digital world.

  

### Conclusion

___

  

Overall, despite really thinking about this experiment at the last minute, and perhaps rambling too much about the theory and less about the practice, I think that this experiment was a success as it allowed me to combine my class experiences and produce something that actually resonates with them all. I think that it really helped me understand how memory in digital format is changing and how we are understanding archives to be in the dangerous frontiers of this computer era.
